        "insight": "Fewer companies signaled price hikes as tariff uncertainty eased in Q3, reducing the need to pre-announce margin actions [^1]. This removes an external justification for across-the-board increases, meaning promotional pricing still drives short-term demand but now carries clearer margin tradeoffs rather than tariff-driven cost offsets. Moving from blanket discounts to partner-funded activations preserves selling price while reallocating net promo spend to activation value.",

        "insight": "Exclusive, week-one product drops in high-traffic stores concentrate intent and move purchases into the early window, improving early_window_share versus a broad discounting cadence [^1]. The mechanism is scarcity-driven urgency plus earned partner media that frontloads visits and purchases, reducing reliance on deeper markdowns to clear stock.

The second-order effect is higher owned-media value per dollar spent because partner funds can be reclassified as media or market-development rather than pure markdown, preserving gross margin relative to blanket discounts. The break point is partner funding share and sell-through; if partner contribution falls or sell-through lags, the margin advantage disappears quickly.",
