Competing approaches: deep discounting will still buy volume but worsens margins; if tests show event CPA >0.8× baseline or QR <5%, stop and reallocate spend to tighter targeted promos or higher-content quality. Keep tests short (≤6 weeks) and use control stores to isolate content effect from broad holiday noise."
