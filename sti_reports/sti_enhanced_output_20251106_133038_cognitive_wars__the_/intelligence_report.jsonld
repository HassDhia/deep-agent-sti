  "abstract": "Recent signals identify three explicit ML detection gaps—drive‑by download detection, Naive Bayes mixed‑performance issues, and failure to detect SQL injection in already‑compromised databases—and reveal pediatric transfusion operational variance: all 18 Canadian pediatric tertiary hospitals responded to a survey, 13 have pediatric‑specific massive hemorrhage protocols (MHPs), and trauma drives 54% of activations. Implications: security and health markets are bifurcating between commoditized baseline suppliers and niche vendors with validated, peer‑reviewed fixes that command premium pricing and M&A attention. Recommended operator actions: deploy layered detection pipelines combining temporal/graph encoders and anomaly‑contrastive modules, instrument labeled‑case curation, adopt low‑latency hardware accelerators and rigorous model‑management; hospitals should implement MHP activation repositories, EHR‑integrated CDS, and inventory reservation workflows with human‑in‑the‑loop safeguards. Investor priorities: fund specialists that credibly close the three ML gaps, infrastructure accelerators (e.g., NPUs/FPGAs), and health‑tech platforms for MHP benchmarking; track peer‑reviewed efficacy and SOC/hospital integrations as leading indicators. Business development moves: productize modular, API‑driven drop‑ins for SIEMs/MSSPs and a pediatric MHP repository bundle with FHIR/EHR connectors, pilot KPIs, and reference sites. Action imperative: convert research gaps into audited pilots to capture premium pricing and reduce operational risk. Prioritize rapid pilot deployments with measurable KPIs, public benchmarking, and clear escalation procedures to accelerate adoption immediately.",
