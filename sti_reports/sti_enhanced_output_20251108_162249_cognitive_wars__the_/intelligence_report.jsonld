  "abstract": "Between Nov 4–8, 2025 a corrigendum correcting Olfati‑Saber, Fax & Murray (2007), a formal erratum, a Springer interdisciplinary update incorporating external \"data on file,\" publication of stronger theoretical results, and a public priority dispute collectively recalibrated confidence in foundational multi‑agent system claims. Critical findings: corrected assumptions and tighter convergence/robustness bounds change operational envelopes for distributed control and raise provenance, reproducibility and adversarial‑risk concerns. Implications for operators: treat theoretical assumptions as live config—embed corrected preconditions into runbooks, automated gating, deterministic simulation tests and telemetry‑linked provenance. For investors: expect capital rotation toward formal‑verification, reproducible testbeds, provenance platforms and defense/cyber assurance; de‑risk through diligence on third‑party validation and milestone‑based tranches. For business development: monetize corrigendum translation—offer reproducible production artifacts, PoCs, indemnities, and standards‑aligned certification. Recommended actions: immediately map deployments to corrected assumptions, implement CI/CD property tests and rollback triggers, prioritize hires/partners with formal‑methods expertise, publish reproducibility reports, and pursue cloud/simulation partnerships and vertical pilots in regulated sectors. Outcome: rapid adopters of corrected theory and provenance tooling gain market and valuation advantage; laggards face reputational, regulatory and commercial risk. Begin clinical translation within 30–90 days with measurable KPIs: reproducibility audits, reduced communication rounds, validated SLAs and third‑party attestations to reassure buyers and limit exposure.",
