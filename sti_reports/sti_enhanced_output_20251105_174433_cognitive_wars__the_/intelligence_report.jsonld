  "abstract": "Recent, aligned signals point to actionable gaps and market opportunities across cybersecurity ML, pediatric transfusion services, and networked control. A five‑year literature review shows persistent detection blind spots—notably drive‑by downloads and post‑compromise SQLi—creating demand for specialized models and labeled telemetry. The same authors explicitly flag drive‑by download detection as a priority research gap. A national survey of 18 Canadian pediatric tertiary hospitals (100% response) documents variable Massive Hemorrhage Protocol (MHP) content and activation practices, prompting calls for a centralized MHP repository and benchmarking dashboard. Distributed observer research further shows that detectability and filter stabilizability depend on communication‑graph properties, driving requirements for resilient messaging and topology-aware designs. Implications: operators must expand telemetry fidelity, deploy edge pre‑filters with centralized retraining, and standardize MHP workflows and containers; investors should fund startups with proprietary datasets, clinical pilots, or graph‑aware observer IP; BD teams should pursue research partnerships, hospital pilots, and OEM integrations. Priority actions: curate labelled drive‑by download datasets and lightweight endpoint detectors, build a national pediatric MHP activation repository with EHR adapters and audit dashboards, and upgrade network stacks for QoS and dynamic topology control. These moves reduce clinical and security blind spots while creating defensible commercial moats and accelerate adoption cycles rapidly.",
