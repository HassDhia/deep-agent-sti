  "abstract": "Short, curated early-access windows plus a two-arm A/B framing (Arm A legacy markdown vs Arm B bundle+GWP+loyalty inside the same two-week window) can hit the unified holiday target pack: **10–15%** foot-traffic uplift (stretch **≥25%** in top markets), **20–30%** early-window transaction share (vs ~12–15% baseline), event CPA **≤0.80×** baseline, and QR/scan redemption **≥5%** of footfall. The mechanism is simple. Limited windows concentrate demand, raise attach rates for bundles and GWPs, and cut markdown leakage versus pure discounting. Collaboration teams must finalize the two-arm test plan, lock inventory and store holdouts, instrument door counts and QR→POS tracking, and align ops, merch, marketing, partnerships, and analytics to execute within the next 30 days [^1][^3].",
