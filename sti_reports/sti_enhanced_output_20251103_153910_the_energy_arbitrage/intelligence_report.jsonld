  "abstract": "Rapidly rising data-center electricity demand is reshaping energy, finance and technology: Wood Mackenzie forecasts ~5 TWh/year incremental U.S. nuclear output to meet baseload needs, NiSource is accelerating capex with ~$2bn additional 2025-2030 spend, Saudi pricing pressure is compressing oil margins, and Europe needs ~€1 trillion of capital to finance its green transition. Operators must integrate grid and compute: upgrade SCADA/EMS telemetry, deploy edge compute for demand-response, adopt energy-aware workload orchestration, and harden OT/IT security while pursuing modular pilots to manage supply-chain risk. Investors should overweight regulated utilities, nuclear operators, data-center REITs and energy-efficient AI hardware vendors, hedge balance-sheet and permitting risk, and prefer infrastructure debt/green bonds to capture stable yields. Business development should offer bundled, financeable energy+compute solutions: outcome-based PPAs, co-funded grid upgrades, managed grid-aware orchestration, and KPI-backed efficiency guarantees; prioritize rapid lead conversion and compliant inbound contact workflows. Immediate actions: launch pilots in predictable jurisdictions, establish JV structures with cloud and EPC partners, stress test financing structures against interest and commodity volatility, and implement measurable ROI frameworks targeting ~10% ops improvement. Entities combining regulated cashflows, firm offtake and execution discipline will win. Accelerate partnerships, standardize energy-compute APIs, and scale proven pilots to secure market share and investor confidence immediately.",
