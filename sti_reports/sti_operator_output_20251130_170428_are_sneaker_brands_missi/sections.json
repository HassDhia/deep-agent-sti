The mechanism: creator residencies generate daily micro-moments that feed TikTok discovery cycles and increase early-window purchaser share when creators have overlapping local audiences [^5][^6].

        "insight": "Blanket holiday discounts reliably lift store visits but reduce per-buyer margin and reset future price expectations [^8][^1]. The mechanism is volume-for-margin: broad price cuts bring lower-intent shoppers and lower AOV, forcing deeper subsequent promotions to protect sales velocity. Compared to collab-led drops, discount-led traffic is wider but shallower; collabs concentrate early-window, higher-margin buyers but require tighter inventory and local hype to match traffic volumes [^6][^2].",

        "insight": "Pilot-level lift from creator residencies and limited drops depends on strict geo, inventory, and timing controls; when you scale broadly, exclusivity erodes and replenishment costs rise, turning media lift into margin leak [^1][^2]. The mechanism is operational friction and cannibalization: more doors offering the same scarcity removes the local novelty and requires more complex SKU controls and tighter replenishment cadence. Discount-based scaling avoids some ops complexity but entrenches lower price expectations across channels and cohorts [^1][^8].",

Mechanically, scarcity converts passive scans into purchase intent because the reward is time- or quantity-limited, creating a short decision horizon at POS. Collab drops and creator activations show higher QR-to-purchase conversion versus blanket discounts where QR becomes redundant [^6][^2].",
        "operator_note": "Deploy QR as a transaction trigger, not a brochure. Tie each QR to a single-use claim or raffle entry, require email/phone capture, and exchange for a time-stamped POS token so you can link scan to purchase within the early-window.",

Prioritize 4–6 week experiments that report foot_traffic_uplift, QR_redemption, early_window_share, and event CPA. Competing approaches: blanket discount-heavy holiday tactics win short-term volume but force deeper cuts across channels; store-as-studio and media-led local collabs trade some scale for higher margin per buyer and quicker learning on community conversion. Run the cheapest orthogonal test first: one flagship creator residency plus a single drop to validate QR and conversion mechanics before scaling promo substitution pilots."
