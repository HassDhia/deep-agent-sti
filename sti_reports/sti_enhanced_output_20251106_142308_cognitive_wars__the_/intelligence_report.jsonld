  "abstract": "Surveyed across 18 Canadian pediatric tertiary hospitals, 13 reported pediatric-specific massive hemorrhage protocols (MHPs) and 10 of those use explicit volume-over-time triggers; trauma drives 54% of activations. Concurrent cybersecurity reviews identify drive-by download detection as a persistent ML gap. Together these signals create actionable opportunities across operations, investment, and business development. Operators should standardize pediatric MHP activations into EHRs and blood‑bank workflows, preconfigure first‑container contents, automate reservations and courier alerts, and deploy dashboards for real‑time stock and post‑event audits; SOCs must add lightweight endpoint detectors plus backend graph forensics and federated update pipelines. Investors should target niche cybersecurity ML startups building drive‑by download and post‑compromise forensics, health‑tech platforms that package pediatric MHP templates and registries, and middleware enabling robust Consensus ADMM orchestration; prioritize companies with signed pilots, curated datasets, and regulatory pathway clarity. BD teams should pursue consortium pilots with trauma hubs, offer modular SaaS bundles (MHP workflow, analytics, integration), license on‑device detection with cloud forensics, and seed national registries via hospital partnerships. Immediate actions: launch targeted pilots, secure labeled telemetry and clinical datasets, prioritize interoperability and MLOps safety, and prepare for M&A or partnership pathways to scale proven solutions. Measure outcomes with KPIs and publish anonymized benchmarking results regularly.",
