  "abstract": "A two-week early-access holiday program paired with a pop-up lab and an Arm A vs Arm B A/B test (Arm A legacy markdown vs Arm B bundle+GWP+loyalty) concentrates attention and converts vacant retail bays into measurable commerce channels [^3][^4][^5]. Target the unified holiday pack: foot-traffic uplift **10–15%** (stretch **≥25%** in top markets), early-window transaction share **20–30%** (vs ~12–15% baseline), event CPA ≤**0.80×** baseline, and QR/scan redemption **≥5%** of footfall. In the next **30 days**, Real Estate, Retail Ops, Marketing, Commerce/Data, and Merchandising must lock pilot sites, instrument door counts and QR→POS flows, define A/B holdouts, tag event SKUs and wire dashboards to track early-window share and CPA [^1][^2][^7]. The operator move is straightforward: run the two-arm early-access in a converted bay, measure incremental footfall and CPA, then scale the winning arm into a cluster of stores [^4][^3].",
