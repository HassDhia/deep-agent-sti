        "insight": "Early-window foot-traffic and sales lift is concentrated among emotionally engaged loyalty members and during high-touch collab activations[^7][^4]. Emotional connection multiplies visits and sales for loyalty members, while collabs drive fast trial but convert primarily through one-time trial mechanics unless tied into repeat engines[^7][^4]. That means loyalty spend buys higher margin-per-visit; collab spend buys reach and new-buyer share but often needs additional mechanics to turn trial into repeat[^5].",

        "insight": "Reallocating spend from blanket discounts to targeted loyalty credits reduces headline discount depth while raising visits among high-LTV segments[^5][^7]. Concentrating small credits on identified repeat prospects increases share-of-wallet and keeps average discount per incremental visit lower than mass promotions; retail media without targeting can expand reach but often raises CPA and compresses contribution margin if attribution is weak[^5][^7].

Forecasts that assume uniform uplift will miss concentration effects and overstate supply needs; collab demand can spike specific SKUs and create stockouts that kill CPA and repeat potential.

When you can attribute a QR redemption or POS-linked promo to a paid impression or collab SKU, you shorten the time to judge CPA and adjust spend in the same planning cycle. Without that capture, retail media and collab results will look like reach but leave CPA and margin unknown.",

    "summary": "For Nov 18–Dec 02, spend the extra dollar where it preserves margin and proves short-term attribution. Targeted loyalty credits buy higher-margin, repeatable early-window lift; collabs buy reach and new-buyer share but must include in-store capture to prove CPA; retail media only justifies scale when attribution is wired and CPA targets hold. Run three-arm pilots, wire QR/POS-to-CRM capture, and measure incremental visits, contribution margin, and CPA before scaling. Instrument those metrics daily and stop the approach that misses the CPA or margin thresholds."

Competing approach: broad discounting still wins short-term volume but erodes margin and reduces signal clarity; only pursue if pilots cannot meet CPA or early-window share targets within the Nov 18 – Dec 02 window."
