  "abstract": "Recent technical signals converge on three advances: (1) an interactive energy state-space model demonstrated on a single RLC circuit that aligns instantaneous and generalized reactive power via a layer-wise interaction variable; (2) a formal correction to the influential 2007 Olfati-Saber/Fax/Murray consensus work that clarifies priority interpretation and yields stronger results affecting distributed consensus assumptions; and (3) a Consensus ADMM tutorial applying ADMM to multi-agent trajectory optimization and providing an implementable augmented-Lagrangian derivation. Combined, these imply a two-layer control pattern—higher-layer reactive-power references mapped to lower-layer enforcement via FBLC or SMC—plus tightened preconditions for safe distributed coordination. Operators should treat the interaction variable as a formal API, adopt staged lab→pilot→limited-live rollouts, procure deterministic controllers and higher-rate telemetry, and update CI/verification suites to reflect corrected consensus assumptions. Investors should favor control-IP, verification toolchains, and software platforms operationalizing corrected consensus/ADMM primitives, and de-risk via milestone-based pilots. Business development should productize certified intermediate reactive-power modules, FBLC/SMC firmware bundles, and consensus-safe ADMM toolkits; pursue co-funded pilots and academic partnerships. Immediate actions: update distributed-control libraries, run HIL/MIL validation, and initiate targeted pilots with verification and safety cases. Execute staged pilots, formal verification, and vendor partnerships within 12–24 months to de-risk deployments, inform procurement, and enable commercial scaling.",
