  "about": "Cognitive Wars: The AI Industrialization of Influence",
  "abstract": "The November ArXiv note corrects a serious proof error in Olfati‑Saber/Fax/Murray (2007), publishes stronger theoretical extensions, clarifies priority, and expands applicability to a defined class of networked multi‑agent consensus problems. This materially reduces epistemic risk for many consensus deployments but forces revalidation of systems built on the uncorrected assumptions. Operators must treat the note as a specification change: inventory affected systems, run formal verification and simulation against corrected preconditions, add runtime assertions in middleware, and execute staged rollouts with telemetry‑based aborts. Investors should reallocate capital toward vendors that rapidly adopt, certify, and productize the corrected theory—priority targets include verification tools, verified middleware, edge/cloud orchestration, and hardware accelerators—while downgrading firms with heavy legacy exposure. Business development should weaponize the correction as a go‑to‑market wedge: offer audit + remediation + continuous assurance packages, form partnerships with the authors and standards bodies, and pursue regulated vertical pilots to capture risk‑averse buyers. Immediate recommended actions: (1) triage and revalidate deployed consensus components, (2) publish certified reference implementations and verification artifacts, and (3) communicate remediation roadmaps to customers and regulators to preserve trust and pricing power. Near‑term M&A and standards activity will accelerate; monitor vendor certifications, public disclosures, and pilot outcomes closely for strategic positioning.",
