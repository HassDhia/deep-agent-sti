  "abstract": "Run a concentrated holiday early-access plus pop-up experiment to hit the unified holiday target pack: detectable foot-traffic uplift **10–15%** (stretch **≥25%** in top markets), early-window transaction share **20–30%** (vs ~12–15% baseline), event CPA ≤**0.80×** baseline, and QR/scan redemption **≥5%** of footfall. Momentum lock. Frame the test as an A/B inside the same two-week window: Arm A legacy markdown versus Arm B bundle+GWP+loyalty to isolate lift and CPA. Brand, operations, analytics, property and data teams must align on the event calendar, door-count instrumentation, QR→POS links and an A/B holdout to deploy **within 30 days** [^2][^1][^3].",
