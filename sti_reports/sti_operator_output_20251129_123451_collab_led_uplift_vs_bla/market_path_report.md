_Executive Take_  
Shift promotional spend from blanket discounts to co-branded early windows and store-as-studio content to protect margins and capture early demand. Favor a collab-led / store-as-studio holiday approach over discount-heavy tactics. ->  tracks Early-window buys ≈ 12–15% of holiday transactions (current) -> Brand Partnerships, Merch and Store Ops must launch the A/B test, schedule three weekend activations, and brief Marketing to produce a four-episode store-as-studio series.

_Operator Moves_
| Immediate | Positioning | Compounding |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Run a six-week A/B test: control = sitewide 20% off; variant = co-branded early-window with tiered bundles and exclusive SKUs; track early_window_share, blended margin, event_cpa, and QR_redemption. | Shift buys into a paid early-window, not a sitewide cut: Signals S1 and S3: co-branded early windows plus bundle replacement of sitewide cuts concentrate buyer share without the same margin hit. | Concentrated partner windows lift early capture and protect margin: Replacing a sitewide 20% cut with co-branded early-window tiered bundles will shift purchases into the window without equivalent margin erosion [^4]. In-store collab activations and short store-as-studio content series accelerate foot traffic and early conversion, boosting short-window share when combined with QR-linked offers [^5][^8]. Instrumented A/B tests at the SKU and bundle level can validate event_cpa and blended margin within six weeks and give clear go/no-go signals for scaling in the next planning cycle [^2]. |

_Decision Map_
| Approach | Best For | When To Choose | When Not To Choose | Key Metrics |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Co-branded early exclusive (paid early-window) | Head of Brand Partnerships and Head of Merch seeking to pull full-price demand into a short window.; Strengths: Concentrates higher-value buyers into a narrow period and leverages partner media to fund reach and scarcity (see S1). A/B testing against sitewide cuts can preserve blended margin while shifting buyer share forward (see S3). | When you can secure partner-funded exclusives, allocate limited SKUs, and gate national sale messaging for a 2-week window. | Do not choose if you cannot prevent sitewide sale signals or if SKU-level margins are under 100bps buffer. | early_window_share, qr_redemption, event_cpa, blended_margin, buyer_share |
| Store-as-studio content drops + weekend activations | Heads of Store Ops and Marketing with flagship or representative stores and basic production capability.; Strengths: Generates measurable foot-traffic uplift via three targeted weekend activations and a short-form content series that drives early-window buys (see S2 and S4). Micro-influencer content amplifies reach without catalog-wide discounts and supports attribution via QR triggers. | When you can staff store activations, produce 3–4 short episodes, and instrument POS with QR tracking over the next 6 weeks. | Avoid if you cannot operationalize live activations across representative stores or cannot measure QR-led conversions. | foot_traffic_uplift, qr_redemption, event_cpa, early_window_share, conversion_rate |
| Tiered collab bundles replacing sitewide discount | Head of Merchandising and Head of Pricing who can run controlled site experiments and manage SKU-level margins.; Strengths: Replaces blanket 20% off with partner-tiered bundles to retain margin while delivering perceived deal via exclusivity (see Pattern match and S3). A/B tests can prove event CPA and blended margin outcomes quickly. | When you can run a 6-week A/B test replacing sitewide discount with tiered bundles and enforce national messaging controls. | Do not choose if you lack SKU-level margin telemetry or cannot isolate customers from broader sale communications. | event_cpa, blended_margin, buyer_share_vs_promo_intensity, AOV, conversion_rate |
_Buyer Guide_
| Option | Best For | Not For | Commercial Shape | Proof Needed | Where STI Fits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Traditional agency retainer | Large retailers needing turnkey creative, national media buy, and cross-door coordination. | Operators with limited budget or who need hyper-local, fast pilots. | Monthly retainer for strategy + per-campaign production and media costs; typical minimum 3-month commitment. | Two pilot markets showing ≥15% foot_traffic_uplift or early_window_share hitting 20% with event_cpa ≤0.8x baseline. | Provide the signal framework, KPI thresholds, and A/B test design for the agency to execute and report against. |
| In-house studio sprint | Operators with an in-house content team and at least one store configured as a production bay. | Teams without production bandwidth or rapid post-production capability. | Fixed 4-episode sprint budget plus per-episode micro-influencer fees and minimal media boost; one 4–6 week engagement. | Single-store test showing early_window_share ≥20% and event_cpa ≤0.8x baseline or foot_traffic_uplift ≥10%. | Deliver episode storyboards tied to QR CTAs, measurement spec, and roll/fail thresholds for scaling to additional doors. |
| Partner-funded pop-up collab | Brands able to secure partner funding for inventory, talent, or promo budget to reduce operator spend. | Commodity categories with low partner marketing interest. | Limited 2-week to 6-week revenue-share or cost-share window where partner covers incentives and some media support. | QR_redemption ≥5% of footfall in the window and event_cpa ≤0.8x baseline while holding blended margin neutral. | Run attribution tags, QR measurement, and provide the decision rules for whether to convert partner pilots into networked offers. |
| Merch + Pricing A/B test lab (internal) | Operators able to run controlled site experiments with SKU-level margin data and traffic split capability. | Organizations without analytics to measure blended margin or isolated traffic cohorts. | Short-term analytics and test budget; internal effort for merchandising changes; typical 6-week test window. | Blended_margin neutral (≤100bps loss) and event_cpa ≤0.8x baseline with buyer_share shifted into target window (20–30%). | Provide test design, success thresholds, and signal-level dashboards to determine scale or stop decisions. |
_Signals & Thesis_

_Measurement Spine_
**Anchors**
| Metric | Target | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Current early-window buyer share | 12–15 % of total holiday transactions | Brand Partnerships | base | Early-window purchase concentration |
| Store foot-traffic uplift target | 10–15 % lift vs baseline | Store Ops | base | Foot-traffic lift from collab activations |
| Event CPA ceiling for partner-led activity | 0–0.8 × baseline CPA | Performance marketing | base | Cost per acquisition vs baseline |

**Measurement Plan**
| Metric | Expression | Window |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Event CPA | CPA ≤ 0.80× baseline CPA — Keeps paid acquisition from eroding margin when swapping sitewide discounts for partner-led offers. | Nov 22–29 (primary), extend per activation |
| Buyer activity share vs promo intensity | Early-window transactions 20–30% while promo-SKU share ≈ last year (no blanket increase) — Protects margin by showing buyer growth came from time-limited collabs not broader discounting. | Nov 29–Dec 12 (co-branded early window) |
| Foot-traffic uplift (store-level) | Visits ↑ 10–15% vs matched-week baseline (stretch ≥25% for high-performing stores) — Direct test of whether in-store collabs drive incremental visits without price cuts. | Next three weekend activations starting Nov 22–Dec 13 |

_Mechanisms_
- **Early-window capture vs sitewide discount** — Replacing blanket sitewide cuts with co-branded early windows concentrates buyer share into narrow timeframes, raising early_window_share without the same margin erosion as a blanket discount [^4][^2]. (Second-order: The mechanism is selective value transfer: exclusive bundles or limited SKUs change purchase timing and mix instead of lowering price across the catalog, preserving blended margin while shifting volume to the partner window [^2][^4].). Constraint: Stop defaulting to sitewide percent cuts. Prioritize exclusive partner SKUs and tiered bundles for the early window. Price test at SKU-bundle level to hold blended margin while measuring buyer share movement into the window.
- **In-store activations move foot traffic, not just conversion** — Short, localized in-store brand activations produce measurable foot-traffic uplifts in the 10 to 25 percent band when targeted to representative stores and weekends, delivering higher-quality visits than broad digital discounts [^8][^5]. (Second-order: The mechanism is neighborhood relevance plus experiential pull; local partners extend reach and drive walk-ins that are more likely to convert at full price or into partner bundles, improving revenue per visit and QR-based attribution [^8][^5].). Constraint: Prioritize three weekend activations across diverse store profiles. Lock partner exclusives and QR incentives. Measure traffic, conversion, AOV, and incremental sales per labor hour.
- **Pricing mechanics: tiered bundles vs volume discounts** — Volume price curves show that staged discounts scale but compress margin across the board, while tiered collab bundles can target discount to lower-margin items or add-on SKUs to protect core margin [^2][^4]. (Second-order: Mechanically, bundles change the product mix and give negotiable headroom for partner compensation without forcing a catalog-wide price change, preserving margin per incremental buyer if event_cpa remains at or below the 0.8x ceiling [^2].). Constraint: Model blended-margin outcomes before launching bundles. Define tier thresholds by profit contribution not by historic discount bands. Keep top-margin core SKUs out of mandatory discount pools.
- **Store-as-studio content converts media to early buys** — A short episodic series filmed in stores with micro-influencers turns media value into measurable early-window share when each drop ties to a timed partner offer or QR activation [^8][^9]. (Second-order: The mechanism is synchronous scarcity: content creates notice and demand while the exclusive offer channels that interest into the store or defined online path, lowering event_cpa relative to generic reach buys [^5][^9].). Constraint: Make content drops conditional. Each episode must include a scannable action that routes to a partner-exclusive bundle. Treat content as a conversion driver not a vanity campaign.

_Window & Guardrails_
- Window: 2025-11-22 -> 2025-11-29
- Region focus: US

_Risks & Exceptions_
- **Promo signaling collapses early-window gains** — Concurrent sitewide discounts, competitor headlines, or uncontrolled public banners that reframe the sale as a general discount. Detect Drop in early_window_share vs baseline; rise in sitewide coupon redemptions; event_cpa rising; search and landing traffic shifting from partner pages to generic sale pages. Mitigate A/B test co-branded early-window vs sitewide control and gate national sale messaging; owner: Merch+Pricing; window: 6 weeks. Stop wider sale comms if variant holds blended margin but loses window share..
- **Blended margin erosion from mis-priced bundles** — Pricing bundles to hit volume targets without SKU-level margin controls; high substitution from full-price SKUs into discounted bundles. Detect Falling blended_margin; SKU-level margin decline; cannibalization_rate (bundle sales replacing full-price sales); lower LTV per cohort. Mitigate Price test at SKU-bundle level and cap discount depth; owner: Merch+Pricing; window: 6 weeks. Pause bundle rollout if blended_margin falls below neutral..
- **Store activations overload ops and degrade CX** — Multiple high-attendance activations in concentrated windows without staffing, inventory or pickup buffers. Detect Store wait_time and queue length rising; in-store conversion falling; pickup OOS and fulfillment delays; NPS or in-store CS contacts increasing. Mitigate Run three weekend pilot activations in representative stores with scaled staffing, extra pickup stock and clear queue SLAs; owner: Store Ops; window: next 6 weeks. Abort activations if wait_time >15 min or NPS drops >10 points..
- **Content-driven CPA inflation without timing lift** — Low-engagement micro-influencer content, weak CTAs or poor audience match leading to high viewership but low conversion. Detect Event_cpa > baseline; low view-to-purchase conversion; no increase in early_window_share; poor view-through attribution. Mitigate Pilot a 4-episode store-as-studio series with cohort-level tracking and a midpoint optimization; owner: Marketing; window: next 6 weeks. Pause if event_cpa >1.0x baseline and early_window_share unchanged..

_Mini Case Story_  
Then: Retailers historically pulled broad sitewide discounts to chase volume during weak consumer sentiment.
Now: Replace blanket 20% off with tiered collab bundles that trade depth of discount for perceived exclusivity and partner reach.
Operator move: A/B test replacing a sitewide 20% off with tiered collab bundles for 6 weeks; hold blended margin neutral and target event_cpa ≤0.8× baseline while tracking buyer activity share vs promo intensity.

_Closing Frame_  
If Early-Window Collab Exclusives is true, Run a six-week A/B test: control = sitewide 20% off; variant = co-branded early-window with tiered bundles and exclusive SKUs; track early_window_share, blended margin, event_cpa, and QR_redemption. becomes optimal.

_One-Line Mental Model_  
> Store-as-studio content amplifies partner exclusives and concentrates buyer activity early, lowering event CPA when audience and offers align.

### Visual Hero

![Brand partnerships lead and store ops align on co-branded early-window bundles.](images/hero_collab_led_uplift_vs_blanket_d.png)

*Trade short-term sitewide cuts for concentrated co-branded early windows. Show the decision tension between pulling buys forward and holding blended margin as a narrow timing choice. One points at a stack of exclusive bundle boxes while the other peels a QR hang-tag. Exchange of a taped plan labeled 'S1'. Precise. Decisive. Ready-to-test.*
